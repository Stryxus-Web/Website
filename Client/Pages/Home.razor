                <hr />
                <p>
                    Born 6th November 1998, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, UK with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiparesis">Left Hemiparesis</a>
                    due to near fatal suffocation at birth, he has strived to understand himself mentally and physically and others with unparralleled detail to live a
                    simpler and healthier life and give comfort to those around him while being unburdening; being as progressive and understanding as possible by defying
                    the ancient as well as modern human status quo of arrogance, power hoarding and selfishness.
